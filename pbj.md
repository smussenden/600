# Process Documentation | How to make a PBJ Sandwich

This "process documentation" contains detailed, step-by-step instructions for the construction of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  

## Assumptions

This process documentation assumes the following:

* One person is making the PBJ sandwich.
* That person is seated at a chair, pulled up to a table.
* That person has washed (with soap) and dried their hands immediately before making the sandwich.
* All the ingredients and tools required to create the sandwich are located on the table, within arms reach of that person.

## Available ingredients and tools.

* A 12 ounce jar of chunk peanut butter, unopened.
* A 12 ounce jar of grape jelly, unopened.
* A loaf of pre-sliced white bread, in a bag closed with a plastic clip.
* A 12-inch dinner plate.
* A butter knife with a lightly serrated edge.


## Open the Peanut Butter Jar

PB1. Grab the jar of peanut butter around the body of the jar with your right hand, gripping tightly.  
PB2. With your right hand continuing to grip the body of the jar tightly, grip the rim of the peanut butter jar lid tightly with your left hand.
PB3. While holding your right hand still, twist the lid counterclockwise 90 degrees with your left hand.
PB4. If the lid separates from the jar at this point, put the jar down on the table and release your grip.  Put the lid on the table and release your grip. Then skip to the next section, "Open the Jelly." If the jar is still not open, skip to step PB5.
PB5. Remove your left hand from the lid completely, then turn your left hand 90 degrees clockwise and regrip the jar.
PB6. Return to step PB3.

## Open the Jelly Jar   

JY1. Grab the jar of jelly around the body of the jar with your right hand, gripping tightly.  
JY2. With your right hand continuing to grip the body of the jar tightly, grip the rim of the jar lid tightly with your left hand.
JY3. While holding your right hand still, twist the lid counterclockwise 90 degrees with your left hand.
JY4. If the lid separates from the jar at this point, put the jar down on the table and release your grip.  Put the lid on the table and release your grip. Then skip to the next section, "Open the Bread Bag." If the jar is still not open, skip to step JY5.
JY5. Remove your left hand from the lid completely, then turn your left hand 90 degrees clockwise and regrip the jar.
JY6. Return to step JY3.

## Open the Bread Bag    

BB1. Pull the bag of white bread close to you.
BB2. Locate the small, white clip pinching together the bag opening.
BB3. Pinch the right side of the clip between your right thumb and right index finger.  Pinch the left side of the clip between your left thumb and left index finger.  
BB4. Pull your right hand towards your body and push your left hand away from your body until the clip separates from the bag material.  
BB5. Set the bag clip on the table.
BB6. Go to the next section, "Select Two Pieces of Bread."

## Select Two Pieces of Bread

SB1. Using your right and left hands, separate the material at the opening of the bread bag.
SB2. With your right hand, reach into the bread bag.
SB3. Locate the two pieces of bread immediately after the first slice in the bag ("the heel").
SB4. Pinch the two pieces of bread between your right thumb and right index finger.  
SB5. Pull your right hand out of the bag.
SB6. Place the two pieces of bread, one on top of the other, onto the plate, and release your grip by separating your thumb and index finger.
SB7. Pinch the top piece of bread between your thumb and index finger of your right hand.  Move the bread just to the left of the bottom piece of bread, set it on the plate, and release your thumb and index finger grip.
SB8. Go to the next section, "Pick up the Knife"

## Pick Up the Knife.
PK1. Using the thumb and index finger on your right hand, pinch the knife at the top of the knife handle, just below the blade.
PK2. Raise the knife off of the table by bending your right arm at the elbow.  
PK3. Wrap the remaining three fingers on our right hand around the knife handle, resting it against your palm. Grip tightly.
PK4. Go to the next section, "Put Peanut Butter on the Knife."

## Put Peanut Butter on the Knife.
PK1. With your left hand, wrap you fingers around the peanut butter jar and grip tightly.
PK2. With your right hand, plunge the blade of the knife deep into the jar of peanut butter (through the opening), at an 80 degree angle (not perfectly perpendicular to the jar).
PK3. Rotate your right hand 90 degrees clockwise to help stick as much peanut butter as you like to the knife blade.  
PK4. Lift your right hand to remove the knife from the jar of peanut butter, so that by the time the knife is completely out of the jar, the blade is essentially parallel to the mouth of the jar and has as much peanut butter as you like resting on top of it.
PK5. Go to the next section, "Spread Peanut Butter on One Piece of Bread."  

## Spread Peanut Butter on One Piece of Bread
BR1. Pinch the left-most piece of bread between the index finger and thumb of your left hand with your palm facing down.
BR2. Rotate your left hand 180 degrees so that your palm faces upwards, Jiggle your hand as needed to position the bread to lay flat onto your palm.  Release your index-finger thumb grip.
BR3. Move your right hand so the peanut butter on the blade of the knife makes contact with the flat surface of the bread, at the edge closest to your left hand fingertips.
BR4. Using light pressure to press the peanut butter into the surface of the bread, drag the knife from one end of the slice of bread to the other.
BR5. When you reach the other end, pull the knife away from the surface of the bread.
BR6. If no peanut butter remains on the knife and the peanut butter on the bread is evenly distributed, then move to step BR7. If not, return the knife to make contact with the flat surface of the bread at the edge closest to your left hand fingertips and return to step BR4.
BR7. Bring the edge of the slice of bread with peanut butter on it into contact with the flat surface of the plate.
BR8. Slide your left hand out from under the slice of bread with peanut butter on it, so that the slice comes to rest on the plate.
BR9. Go to the next section, "Spread Jelly on the Other Piece of Bread."

## Put Jelly on the Knife
JK1. With your left hand, wrap you fingers around the jelly jar and grip tightly.
JK2. With your right hand, plunge the blade of the knife deep into the jar of jelly (through the opening), at an 80 degree angle (not perfectly perpendicular to the jar).
JK3. Rotate your right hand 90 degrees clockwise to help stick as much jelly as you like to the knife blade.  
JK4. Lift your right hand to remove the knife from the jar of jelly, so that by the time the knife is completely out of the jar, the blade is essentially parallel to the mouth of the jar and has as much jelly as you like resting on top of it.
JK5. Go to the next section, "Spread Jelly on the Other Piece of Bread."  

## Spread Jelly on the Other Piece of Bread
JB1. Pinch the right-most piece of bread (the one with no peanut butter on it) between the index finger and thumb of your left hand with your palm facing down.
JB2. Rotate your left hand 180 degrees so that your palm faces upwards, and jiggle your hand as needed to position the bread to lay flat onto your palm.  Release your index-finger thumb grip.
BR3. Move your right hand so the jelly on the blade of the knife makes contact with the flat surface of the bread, at the edge closest to your left hand fingertips.
BR4. Using light pressure to press the peanut butter into the surface of the bread, drag the knife from one end of the slice of bread to the other.
BR5. When you reach the other end, pull the knife away from the surface of the bread.
BR6. If no peanut butter remains on the knife and the peanut butter on the bread is evenly distributed, then move to step BR7. If not, return the knife to make contact with the flat surface of the bread at the edge closest to your left hand fingertips and return to step BR4.
BR7. Bring the edge of the slice of bread with peanut butter on it into contact with the flat surface of the plate.
BR8. Slide your left hand out from under the slice of bread with peanut butter on it, so that the slice comes to rest on the plate.
BR9. Go to the next section, "Spread Jelly on the Other Piece of Bread."



BR6. Turn the knife over. Return to step 4.
