This "process documentation" document contains detailed, step-by-step instructions for the construction of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  

## Assumptions

This process documentation assumes the following:

* One person is making the PBJ sandwich.
* That person is seated at a chair, pulled up to a table of adequate size for completion of the task.
* That person has washed and dried their hands immediately before making the sandwich.
* All the ingredients and tools required to create the sandwich are located on the table, within arms reach of that person.
* Unless otherwise explicitly instructed, the person following this process documentation should move from one ordered instruction to the ordered instruction that immediately follows it. For example, the maker should move to step PB2  immediately after finishing PB1.  When the person reaches the last ordered step in each section, they should move to the next section.
* The finished sandwich will remain in one piece.  It will not be cut into two halves, or have the crusts removed.
* Cleanup of the work area and consumption of the sandwich are not required tasks. The steps required to complete those tasks are not included here.

## Ingredients and Tools

The following ingredients and tools are available to the person making the sandwich:

* A 12 ounce screw-top jar of creamy peanut butter, with the lid closed.
* A 12 ounce screw-top jar of grape jelly, with the lid closed.
* A loaf of pre-sliced white bread, in a plastic bag closed with a standard, plastic bag tie clip.
* A 12-inch dinner plate.
* A butter knife with a lightly serrated edge.

## Section 1: Open the Peanut Butter Jar

* PB1. Grab the jar of peanut butter by wrapping your right hand around the body, gripping tightly.  
* PB2. With your right hand continuing to grip the body of the jar tightly, grip the rim of the peanut butter jar lid tightly with your left hand.
* PB3. While holding your right hand still, twist the lid counterclockwise 90 degrees with your left hand.
* PB4. If the lid separates from the jar at this point, put the jar down on the table, release your grip and go to the next section, "Section 2: Open the Jelly Jar." If the jar is still not open, move to step PB5.
* PB5. Remove your left hand from the lid completely, then turn your left hand 90 degrees clockwise and regrip the jar.
* PB6. Return to step PB3.

## Section 2: Open the Jelly Jar   

* JY1. Grab the jar of jelly by wrapping your right hand around the body, gripping tightly.  
* JY2. With your right hand continuing to grip the body of the jar tightly, grip the rim of the jar lid tightly with your left hand.
* JY3. While holding your right hand still, twist the lid counterclockwise 90 degrees with your left hand.
* JY4. If the lid separates from the jar at this point, put the jar down on the table, release your grip and go to the next section, "Section 3: Open the Bread Bag." If the jar is still not open, move to step JY5.
* JY5. Remove your left hand from the lid completely, then turn your left hand 90 degrees clockwise and regrip the jar.
* JY6. Return to step JY3.

## Section 3: Open the Bread Bag    

* BB1. Pull the bag of white bread close to you.
* BB2. Locate the small, white clip pinching together the bag opening.
* BB3. Pinch the right side of the clip between your right thumb and right index finger.  Pinch the left side of the clip between your left thumb and left index finger.  
* BB4. Pull your right hand towards your body and push your left hand away from your body until the clip separates from the bag material.  
* BB5. Set the bag clip on the table.
* BB6. Go to the next section, "Section 4: Select Two Pieces of Bread."

## Section 4: Select Two Pieces of Bread

* SB1. Grip opposite sides of the bread bag at the opening with the index finger and thumb on your right and left hands.
* SB2. Separate the material at the opening of the bread bag by pulling your hands apart. Let go of the bread bag.
* SB3. With your right hand, reach into the bread bag.
* SB4. Locate the two pieces of bread located just beyond the first slice in the bag ("the heel").
* SB5. Pinch the two pieces of bread between your right thumb and right index finger.  
* SB6. Pull your right hand out of the bag.
* SB7. Place the two pieces of bread onto the plate, with one sitting on top of the other. Release your grip by separating your thumb and index finger.
* SB8. Pinch the top piece of bread between your thumb and index finger of your right hand.  Move the bread in your grip to the left side of the plate, positioning it parallel to the other piece. Release your thumb and index finger grip.
* SB9. Go to the next section, "Section 5: Pick up the Knife."

## Section 5: Pick Up the Knife
* PU1. Using the thumb and index finger on your right hand, pinch the knife at the top of the knife handle, just below the blade.
* PU2. Raise the knife off of the table by raising your arm.  
* PU3. Wrap the remaining three fingers on your right hand around the knife handle, resting the handle against your palm. Grip tightly.
* PU4. Go to the next section, "Section 6: Put Peanut Butter on the Knife."

## Section 6: Put Peanut Butter on the Knife
* PK1. With your left hand, wrap you fingers around the peanut butter jar body and grip tightly.
* PK2. With your right hand, plunge the blade of the knife deep into the jar of peanut butter (through the opening), at an 80 degree angle (almost, but not quite, perfectly perpendicular to the jar opening).
* PK3. Rotate your right hand 90 degrees clockwise to help stick as much peanut butter as possible to the knife blade.  
* PK4. Lift your right hand to remove the knife from the jar of peanut butter, so that by the time the knife is completely out of the jar, the blade is essentially parallel to the mouth of the jar and has as much peanut butter as possible resting on top of it.
* PK5. Go to the next section, "Section 7: Spread Peanut Butter on One Piece of Bread."  

## Section 7: Spread Peanut Butter on One Piece of Bread
* BR1. Pinch the left-most piece of bread between the index finger and thumb of your left hand with your palm facing down.
* BR2. Rotate your left hand 180 degrees so that your palm faces upwards, jiggling your hand as needed to position the bread to lay flat onto your palm.  Release your grip.
* BR3. Move your right hand so the peanut butter on the blade of the knife makes contact with the flat surface of the bread, at the edge closest to the fingertips of your left hand.
* BR4. Using light pressure to press the peanut butter into the surface of the bread, drag the knife from one end of the slice of bread to the other.
* BR5. When you reach the other end, pull the knife away from the surface of the bread.
* BR6. If no peanut butter remains on the knife and the peanut butter on the bread is evenly distributed, then move to step BR7. If not, return the knife to its starting position, in contact with the flat surface of the bread at the edge closest to your left hand fingertips and move to step BR4.
* BR7. With your left hand palm stretched flat, bring the edge of the slice of bread with peanut butter on it into contact with the flat surface of the plate.
* BR8. Slide your left hand from underneath the slice of bread with peanut butter on it, so that the slice comes to rest on the plate.
* BR9. Go to the next section, "Section 8: Put Jelly on the Knife."

## Section 8: Put Jelly on the Knife
* JK1. With your left hand, wrap you fingers around the jelly jar body and grip tightly.
* JK2. With your right hand, plunge the blade of the knife deep into the jar of jelly (through the opening), at an 80 degree angle (almost, but not quite, perfectly perpendicular to the jar).
* JK3. Rotate your right hand 90 degrees clockwise to help stick as much jelly as possible to the knife blade.  
* JK4. Lift your right hand to remove the knife from the jar of jelly, so that by the time the knife is completely out of the jar, the blade is essentially parallel to the mouth of the jar and has as much jelly as possible resting on top of it.
* JK5. Go to the next section, "Section 9: Spread Jelly on the Other Piece of Bread."  

## Section 9: Spread Jelly on the Other Piece of Bread
* JB1. Pinch the right-most piece of bread (the one with no peanut butter on it) between the index finger and thumb of your left hand with your palm facing down.
* JB2. Rotate your left hand 180 degrees so that your palm faces upwards, jiggling your hand as needed to position the bread to lay flat onto your palm.  Release your grip.
* JB3. Move your right hand so the jelly on the blade of the knife makes contact with the flat surface of the bread, at the edge closest to the fingertips of your left hand.
* JB4. Using light pressure to press the jelly into the surface of the bread, drag the knife from one end of the slice of bread to the other.
* JB5. When you reach the other end, pull the knife away from the surface of the bread.
* JB6. If no jelly remains on the knife and the jelly on the bread is evenly distributed, then move to step JB7. If not, return the knife to its starting position, in contact with the flat surface of the bread at the edge closest to your left hand fingertips and move to step JB4.
* JB7. Bring the edge of the slice of bread with jelly on it into contact with the flat surface of the plate.
* JB8. Slide your left hand out from under the slice of bread with jelly on it, so that the slice comes to rest on the plate.
* JB9. Go to the next section, "Section 10: Assemble the Sandwich."

## Section 10: Assemble the Sandwich

* AS1. Place your left hand (with palm up, fingers extended), on the table just to the left of the left edge of the plate.  
* AS2. With the fingertips of your right hand, push the bread with peanut butter off the plate to the left, so that it comes to rest in the open palm of your left hand, with the peanut butter side up.
* AS3. In one quick motion, rotate the palm of your hand 180 degrees, and place the peanut-butter side of the bread directly on top of the jelly side of the piece of bread remaining on the plate. The sandwich is now complete.
