5.6 PBJ	Documentation:	10%	Total
For	this	assignment,	you	will	develop	detailed,	step-by-step	process	documentation	of	how
to	make	a	quintessentially	American	delicacy:	a	peanut butter	and	jelly	(or	jam)	sandwich.
Your	process	documentation	must	be	explicit	and	comprehensive,	so	leave	no	room	for
confusion.	While	this	task	might	initially	appear	simple,	it	offers	a	good	example	of	the
challenges	of	technical	writing;	if	you	have	questions,	ask!	It	will	also	be	a	lot	more	fun	and
interesting	if	you	do	not	search	the	web	for	examples.	As	always,	make	sure	to	proofread
your	documentation	for	spelling	and	grammar	to	receive	full	credit.
On	Canvas,	submit	the	URL	for	a	word	processing	or	Markdown	document	on	Git
